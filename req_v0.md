I want to design a tool to help with fundamental analysis for stock trading. It contains
1. A UI to visualize all the information
2. A database to store the important financial data for a company

On the UI, there is a place where i can input a stock ticker, then it will show the following data in the past 8 quarters (2 years)
* EPS
* Free cash flow
* gross income / margin
* new income / margin
* Capex
* Cash balance / debt

It will first search the database for those information. If none is found or some information is missing, then it will go online to get those information to display and store then into the database.
